# stock website
# Please watch the video to see how it works!

It is a stock website by calling API for stock information. I used Python and django to build a stock market website that can connect to a third party API to collect stock market information, let users save stock ticker symbols to the database, and eventually present it as table format. The website was also styled using Bootstrap CSS framework.
